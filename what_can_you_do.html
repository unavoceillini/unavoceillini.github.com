<h2>What Can You Do?</h2>

<h3>Pray for it</h3>

<p>
This recommendation is obvious, yet not to be neglected! Our Lord
instructed us to ask, seek and knock
<a href="http://www.drbo.org/x/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=7&l=7#x">(Mt 7:7)</a>.
</p>

<h3>Express your views</h3>

<p>
to your friends, family, pastor, and other Catholics. By articulating
yourself, you can raise awareness that the Latin Mass continues to be an
approved liturgical tradition of the Church, rather than an antiquated
practice to be feared or suppressed. Share this beautiful treasure of
the Faith!
</p>

<h3>Request it</h3>

<p>
from your pastor. Under <i><a href="http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/summorum-pontificum.html">Summorum Pontificum</a></i>, 
the pastor at any parish of the Latin Rite has the authority and right
to offer or bring the the celebration of the extraordinary form at that
parish. The pastor can learn and offer the extraordinary form himself,
or he could permit another priest to celebrate it in the parish. Be
certain to offer any and all assistance necessary for adding such a Mass
to the parish schedule.
</p>

web resource dedicated to the Traditional Latin Mass is <a

for yourself why devotion to the Latin Mass is growing!
</p>

<h3>Write to Bishop Jenky</h3>

<p>
Simply let him know of your desire for more Latin Masses according to
the 1962 Missal. Respectfully urge his official approval for more such
Masses. If our bishop continues to hear from those who are interested,
he will respond to the very real pastoral need to provide these Masses
on a regular basis. Write to:

<p>
Please note that the bishop's permission is <i>not</i> necessary for Latin
Mass. Pope Benedict XVI acknowledged the right of every Roman Rite priest
to celebrate the traditional Latin Mass. Even so, the bishop can advance
access to the traditional Mass according the Pope's vision. For instance,
he could invite the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter (or another priestly
organization devoted to the Latin Mass) into the diocese to provide
pastoral care for those who request it. Over half of the bishops and
dioceses in the US have now done so. In the diocese of Peoria, *insert
current situation here.*
