Una Voce Illini is a newly established council in Champaign-Urbana, we
are in the process of officially becoming part of the larger Una Voce
International Federation. We are a group of faithful Roman Catholics
who share the goal of promoting and facilitating the celebration of
the extraordinary form of the Mass (also known as the traditional Latin
Mass or the Tridentine Latin Mass). We also support and promote related
traditional practices, such as Gregorian chant.
