<p>
Una Voce Illini is an official chapter of <a href="http://unavoce.org/">Una
Voce America</a> in Champaign-Urbana.  We are a group of faithful
Roman Catholics who share the goal of promoting and facilitating the
celebration of the extraordinary form of the Mass (also known as the
Traditional Latin Mass or the Tridentine Latin Mass). We also support
and promote related traditional practices, such as Gregorian chant.
</p>

<h3>May 30 - Meeting and Holy Hour at St. Elizabeth</h3>

<p>
Holy Hour for Corpus Christi on Thursday, May 30th at 6:30 PM at
St. Elizabeth in Thomasboro, IL. Followed by a reflection by Father Bird,
and a talk by Una Voce Illini on the Extraordinary Form of the Mass,
in the social hall at 7:30 PM. Donuts and light refreshments will be
provided by Una Voce Illini.
</p>

<p>
I am sad to say this will be our last event with Father Bird. Father
Bird is being reassigned to the Quad Cities. We thank him for all that
he has done for us, for his prayers, and the beautiful mass he offered
on Ascension Thursday. Pray that God will bless Father Bird's ministry
and send us many more Masses in the Extraordinary Form!
</p>

<p>
St. Elizabeth is approximately 11 miles from St. John's Catholic Newman
Center. If you are a student and need a ride to attend the mass or are
able to offer rides please email UnaVoceIllini@gmail.com.
