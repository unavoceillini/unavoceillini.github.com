<h2><a name="q1">
What is the Latin Mass?
</a></h2>

<p>
The Latin Mass has many names - the traditional Latin Mass, the Tridentine
Mass, the Mass of Saint Gregory the Great, and since 2007 has been
officially called the extraordinary form of the Mass. These names all
refer to the Roman Catholic Mass celebrated according to the Roman Missal
which was promulgated by St. Pius V in 1570 and was reissued by Blessed
John XXIII in 1962. This particular Mass is distinctly different from
the Mass that most Roman Catholics have celebrated according to the
Roman Missal issued by Pope Paul VI in 1970.
</p>

<p>
Some Catholics refer to this Mass as the Tridentine Mass, as this
Mass was officially codified by the the Council of Trent in the 16th
century. However, this particular form of the Mass has been handed
down over the centuries with only small and gradual changes since the
pontificate of St. Gregory the Great in the sixth century.
</p>


<h2>><a name="q2">
What is the status of the Latin Mass in the Church? Wasn't the old Mass abrogated after Vatican II?
</a></h2>

<p>
Despite popular beliefs to the contrary, the 1962 Roman Missal was never
abrogated. As Pope Benedict XVI observed, "What earlier generations held
as sacred, remains sacred and great for us, too."
</p>

<p>
Even after the introduction of the new rite of Mass in 1969, many priests
were accorded permission to continue celebrating the traditional Latin
Mass. In 1984, Pope John Paul II extended that permission, and in 1988,
he requested that bishops be generous in application of that permission.
</p>

<p>
According to <i>Summorum Pontificum, </i> use of the 1962 Roman missal and
traditional forms of the sacraments are permissible and encouraged. Any
qualified priest may offer the extraordinary form of the Mass privately,
and the faithful may attend such private Masses (SP, Art. 2, 4, 5.4) The
decision to have public Mass in the extraordinary form is up to the pastor
of the parish; permission from the bishop is not necessary (SP, Art. 5)
Requests from the faithful for special Masses in the extraordinary form,
such as weddings and funerals, should be granted (SP, Art. 5)
</p>


<h2>><a name="q2">What is Summorum Pontificum?</a></h2>

<p>
On July 7, 2007, Pope Benedict XVI <i>Summorum Pontificum, </i> an
apostolic letter clarifying the status of the 1962 Missal and other
traditional sacramental rites. In brief, the letter stated that the 1962
Missal was never negated, and that the traditional Latin Mass should be
considered the "extraordinary" form of the Roman liturgy.
</p>

<p>

website

</p>

<p>

<h2>><a name="q3">
Why is Latin Mass so important to some Catholics? Isn't liturgy a matter
of personal preference?
</a></h2>

<p>
The liturgy is intimately bound with the truths of the Catholic faith. The
relationship between our worship and belief is encapsulated by the Latin
phrase "lex orandi, lex credendi" (which translates loosely as the "how
we pray is how we believe." Pope Pius XII taught that the liturgy must
conform and reflect the truths of the Faith - so much that the liturgy
even safeguards those truths (<i>Mediator Dei</i>).
</p>

<p>
For these reasons, many Catholics who favor the traditional Latin Mass
as a particular means for communicating and safeguarding their faith. In
a secularized world, the traditional Latin Mass helps us be rooted in
the in the tradition and heritage of the Church. The sacred liturgy that
nourished countless saints over the centuries can continue to evangelize,
instruct, and sanctify Catholics into the future as well.
</p>



<h2>><a name="q4">How will I know when to sit, stand, and kneel?</a></h2>

<p>
Contrary to common assumptions, there are no written norms or rubrics
that specify the posture of the people at traditional Latin Masses. Most
postures are the result of local cultures and customs. In general,
follow the postures of the altar servers.
</p>

<p>
The Catholic diocese of Austin offers a great short list of typical
postures on their website

<h2>><a name="q6">Why the silence in the Mass?</a></h2>

<p>
In the traditional Latin Mass, the priest is instructed to use three
separate tones of voice: low, medium, and high. At times, the priest
prays so quietly that the congregation cannot hear, nor are they intended
to hear.
</p>

<p>
Silence within the Mass represented a hushed awe in which the faithful
contemplate the sublime mystery of Christ's redemptive sacrifice made
present upon the altar. Contemplation and a sense of timelessness pervade
this silence.
</p>

<h2>><a name="q7">Why Latin?</a></h2>

<p>
Even after the use of vernacular Latin died (around the 8th century),
the use of Latin in the Church continued for over 1200 years. Some
reasons for this decision include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Universality</b>. The Catholic Church is not a national church, but rather is universal; thus, a universal language, such as Latin, is appropriate for the Church's worship.
</li>

<li>
<b>Stability</b>. Since Latin is a dead language, use of Latin prevents
us from perpetually altering liturgical texts. Constant alteration of
texts may negatively affect communication and teaching of doctrine. Pope
Pius XII commented on this very topic: "The use of the Latin language
prevailing in a great part of the Church affords at once an imposing
sign of unity and an effective safeguard against the corruption of true
doctrine." (<i>Mediator Dei</i>)
</li>

<li>
<b>Tradition</b>. We acknowledge that on top of the cross where Christ died,
the phrase "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews" was written in Hebrew,
Greek, and Latin. Along with some expressions of Hebrew and Greek
(e.g. the <i>Kyrie</i>), use of Latin offers historical continuity from
the days of Christ, old Rome, and the see of St. Peter.
</li>
</ul>

Vatican II documents, while also permitting the vernacular, urged the
preservation of Latin in worship: "The use of Latin, with due respect to
particular law, is to be preserved in the Latin Rites" (<i>Sacrosanctum
Concilium</i>, #36)



<h2>><a name="q8">Do I have to know Latin to attend the traditional Latin Mass?</a></h2>

<p>
No background in Latin is necessary for attending and appreciating the
traditional Latin Mass. You may consider obtaining a bilingual 1962
Missal for reading and meditating upon the prayers of the Mass. Even if
you don't have a missal handy, you can immerse yourself in the visual,
auditory, and kinesthetic experiences of the liturgy that bring you to
unity with God.
</p>

<h2>><a name="q9">Why does the priest turn away from the people?</a></h2>

<p>
In the traditional Latin Mass, the priest does not "turn away"
from the people; rather, he is facing <i>with them </i>toward the
altar.
</p>

<h2>><a name="q9">How and why is the Communion Rite different?</a></h2>

<h2>><a name="q10">How should people dress for a traditional Latin Mass? Must men wear suits? Must women wear chapel veils (i.e. mantillas)?</a></h2>

<p>
You may notice that people tend to dress more formally at traditional
Latin Masses than at ordinary form Masses in the United States.
Most frequently, women wear dresses or skirts and blouses; men typically
wear either suit and tie or shirt and tie. Please dress modestly and
appropriate to the occasion. Whenever Catholics attend Mass, they should
avoid clothes that are physically revealing, vain or especially casual.
</p>

<p>
At most traditional Latin Masses, you may notice that many women wear
hats or veils. These head coverings are an ancient custom from the time
of Paul to today. The ladies' head coverings were required under the
1917 code of canon.
</p>

<p>
Cardinal Raymond Burke has explained that ladies' head coverings for the
extraordinary form are expected, yet it is also not a sin to refrain
from this devotion. The full text of his commentary is available 
<a href="http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/head_coverings_in_church.htm">here</a>.
